Here is a list (in order) of what I think we should implement first. Feel free
to PULL this and change it (DO NOT FORK THIS, PULL IT).

1. Red circle can move with keyboard (the balloon)

2. Triangles flying across screen (arrows)
    -random velocity
    -random sizes
    -starting at random places moving across X axis

3. Collisions (see example code)
    -what happens when circle hits triangle?

4. When to increase arrow amount
    -increase every minute?

5. Time
    -increase score
    -increase triangles
